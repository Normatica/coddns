# coddns

The coddns system is a HTML-PHP-PostgreSQL console working through scripts with
Bind9 to provide a dynamic DNS resolution over the hosts registered through the
console.

It could be used to manage an own DNS server on your LAN, or classroom, for, in
example, associate dynamically DNS registers to the students's computer so it
could work without asking "hey! what was your IP?".

Over Internet, you can make something like me in http://coddns.org so the name
resolution is applied to everybody who wants to know them IP address, without
being checking manually their router.

Direct access without a static Ip address, cool, isn't it? :D

All info needed is displayed (in spanish) on the PDF files in the coddns_cod 
folder, please read it.


Thank you,
